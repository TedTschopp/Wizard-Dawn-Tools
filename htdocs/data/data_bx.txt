This is the data file for the 1981 version of Moldvay's Basic Dungeons & Dragons™.  This consists of creatures
and treasure from the Basic and Expert rule books. You can use this with some of the tools here that allow for
data files to be input. You may only want to use this file if you want to customize your creations. You may have
no electrum in your land or maybe you want to remove the chance of dragons from appearing. You may want to add
custom monsters and items. Anything is possible.
