This is the data file for Metamorphosis Alpha. It has creatures from the Broken Urthe game and consists of normal animals, mutants, and robots.
You can use this with some of the tools here that allow for data files to be input. You may only want to use this file
if you want to customize your creations. You may use bottle caps for currency in your land or maybe you want to remove
the chance of certain creatures from appearing. You may want to add custom monsters and items. Anything is possible.
