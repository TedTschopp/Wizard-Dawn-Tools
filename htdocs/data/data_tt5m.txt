This is the data file for the Tunnels & Trolls™ 5th Edition role-playing game.

There are about 500 creatures, traps, treasure, and containers from the Magestykc™ supplement.
You can use this with some of the tools here that allow for data files to be input. You may only want to use 
this file if you want to customize your creations. You may have no gold in your land or maybe you want to 
remove the chance of dinosaurs from appearing. You may want to add custom monsters and items. Anything is possible.
