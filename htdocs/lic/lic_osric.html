<p><strong>OSRIC™ Open License:</strong></p>
<p>Terms used herein are as defined in the OPEN GAME LICENSE Version 1.0a 
promulgated by Wizards of the Coast, Inc. Open Game Content may only be Used 
under and in terms of the Open Game License.</p>
<p>Subject to the other terms of this license, you may do the following:</p>
<p>1) Distribute this document for free or for profit, provided that no change 
or addition is made other than adding your name as publisher if the product is 
distributed in print, other than by print on demand.</p>
<p>2) Refer in your own products to the name of this document, and indicate 
compatibility with the OSRIC<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> system.</p>
<p>3) Produce content that is derivative of the &quot;Licensed IP&quot; material in this 
document, provided that your product is not a complete game.</p>
<p>4) Include quotations from the rules set forth in the OSRIC™ system, provided 
that such quotes do not individually exceed 100 words or collectively comprise 
more than 10% of your product.</p>
<p>5) Identify parts of your Product Identity as &quot;OSRIC™ Open Content&quot; that may 
be used by other OSRIC<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> publishers, but only 
OSRIC<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> publishers, as if it were Open Game 
Content. Note that Open Game Content may not be limited to OSRIC<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> 
publishers, only Product Identity.</p>
<p>6) Identify parts of your Product Identity as &quot;OSRIC™ Reference Content,&quot; in 
which case other publishers may refer to the OSRIC<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> 
Reference Content provided that they identify the source of the reference (your 
work) and note on the cover of their product that your product is required in 
order to use their product.</p>
<p>7) If a publisher fails to identify OSRIC™ Open or Reference content, that 
content will be considered Product Identity, assuming that it is valid Product 
Identity under the OGL.</p>
<p>If you do any of the foregoing, you must:</p>
<p>1) Comply with the terms of the Wizards of the Coast (WOTC) Open Game License 
with respect to any use of Open Game Content</p>
<p>2) Not violate or infringe upon any trademark of WOTC (moreover, note that 
the OGL currently prohibits any indication of compatibility with a trademark 
without written permission).</p>
<p>3) Include the following text prominently on the cover or cover page of your 
product: </p>
<blockquote>
	This product uses the OSRIC™ System (Oldschool System Reference and Index 
	Compilation™). The OSRIC™ system text may be found at http://www.knights-n-knaves.com/osric.

<p>Complimentary copies of OSRIC™ material need not be sent to the authors, but 
it would be nice.</p>

artwork, trademarks, and title.</p>
<p>Under no circumstance should this license be construed to violate the terms 
of the Open Game License, and any term that violates the Open Game License is to 
be construed as closely as possible to the original intent within the terms of
